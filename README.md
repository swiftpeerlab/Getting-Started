# Getting Started and Inspired

So is this your first time at a Peer Lab? Or maybe you are already part of the community?

Nevertheless this document will guide you and act as a source of inspiration to enjoy and learn with your colleagues.

# Idea

The idea is simple, but profound: developers gather in a physical space to work.

- If you have a question, ask the group. 

- If you can help, offer assistance. 

Remember: the goal is to foster a collaborative learning environment where everyone feels welcome and safe.

# What should I do?

You can use the time as you want, there is no defined structure so you have full autonomy.

Here are some ideas:

- Practice your coding skills with a Kata you can find useful ones [here](http://agilekatas.co.uk), [here](http://codekata.com) and [here](http://codingdojo.org/kata/);
- Contribute to an open source project, [here](https://github.com/dkhamsing/open-source-ios-apps) you can find a list of them;
- Learn about a [new framework or programming concept](https://github.com/swiftpeerlab/resources);
- Ask for help on a problem you are facing in your current project;
- Start a new project;
- Network with your peers, did you learn something this week you want to share?
- Use one of the Peer Lab projects as a starting point, we have a [mobile app](https://github.com/swiftpeerlab/Poppin) and a [mobile game](https://github.com/swiftpeerlab/Bomba)

Tips: If you have already experience try to pair with someone with less experience and teach them something you know, that way you also learn by explaining and you get your assumptions questioned.

# Group

We a Slack group to exchange messages and informations you can sign up [here](https://join.slack.com/t/swiftpeerlab/shared_invite/enQtMzU5MzE5ODY0OTk5LTA5NmJjZmZkMjg0NjhjNzVjNzA3MGU0MTFjNTUyZjdjMTg4ZjdjODcwZGEwNzA1ODU1ODIzNTNjNmY5MmRiMWE)
